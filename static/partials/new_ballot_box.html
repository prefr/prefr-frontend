        <h3>Introduction</h3>        

        <p>
            Pick a question or matter to be decided by a group. <em>(e.g. "What should we do this weekend?")</em>        
            Then provide potential answers or options to be ranked, something like this:
        </p>        

        <ul class ="ui-extensive-width">
            <li><i class = "fa fa-caret-right"></i> Have a LAN party.</li>
            <li><i class = "fa fa-caret-right"></i> Play some board games.</li>
            <li><i class = "fa fa-caret-right"></i> Go see a movie.</li>
            <li><i class = "fa fa-caret-right"></i> Keep coding.</li>
        </ul>   
        <p>
            After that invite friends or colleagues to participate by ranking your options and have this app calculate the group's collective preference ranking by a method of your choice (only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method">schulze method</a> available at the moment).
        </p>

        <button

    <div ng-if = "step == 1">
        <h3>Subject matter</h3>

        <p>
            Now, ask a question or pick a subject matter:
        </p>

        <label class = "ui-white subject">
            <span> Subject: </span>
            <input 
                type        = "text" 
                ng-model    = "ballot.subject" 
                placeholder = "Enter subject"
                class       = "ui-extensive-width"
            >
            <div class = "icons right">
                <i class = "fa fa-pencil"></i>
            </div>

        </label>

        <p>
            You may want to add further details if the subject line was too short to put all the information into. <em>(e.g. "We'll be at least 6 people at 3pm. Two more may join until 6pm. There is no limited on the budget. Food will be provided.")</em>
        </p>

        <label class = "ui-white">
            <span> Details: </span>
            <div class = "icons right">
                <i class = "fa fa-pencil"></i>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <div class="wrapper">
                <textarea placeholder = "Enter details" extendable ng-model = "ballot.details" placeholder = "Enter details"></textarea>
            </div>
        </label>  

        <p>
            You can change the subject and details later on if you like. But keep in mind that your participants may not notice in time and will be unable to update their ranking accordingly.
        </p>


        <div class = "ui-extended-height"></div>

        <button

            Next (options)

    <div ng-if = "step == 2">
        
        <h3>Options</h3>
        <p>
            Options represent the possible outcomes of the decision to be made. Each participant will rank these options according to her preference.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can add as many as you like and you can add, remove and edit options later on. But be aware that some participants may not notice later changes and therefore won't be able to update their rankings to be in line with your changes.

        <h3>How to participate</h3>

        <p>
            It is done. Your ballot is online.
        </p>

        <p>
            To cast a vote use either of the two links below. The first one ist your admin link. With it you can make changes to the ballot. The second one is the link for others to cast their vote - you should give it to those you want to participate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Admin link: <br/>
            <small>
                <a href = "{{adminLink}}">{{adminLink}}</a><br/>             
            </small>

            <br/>

            Participant link: <br/>
            <small>
                <a href = "{{participantLink}}">{{participantLink}}</a>
            </small>
        </p>

        <p>
            Both links allow you to add as many new partcipants as you like. You can even remove or change the votes of others.
