			<p>

			<p>
				You may want to add further details if the subject line was too short to put all the information into. <em>(e.g. "We'll be at least 6 people at 3pm. Two more may join until 6pm. There is no limited on the budget. Food will be provided.")</em>

			   This is a special option. You can use it in your prefr ballot if you like, but you don't have to. It is useful though if you want to allow your participants to reject options altogether. They can do that by ranking the disliked option lower than the Status Quo. If in the end the status quo wins the ballot, all options are rejected.

			You can rename the Staus Quo option to whatever you like. And you should do so depending on your subject, e.g.:  
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<em>What should we do on the weekend?</em> 
			<br/> <i class = "fa fa-caret-right"></i> Status Quo: "Don't do any of the suggested activities."
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<em>What should we paint the shack with?</em> 
			<br/> <i class = "fa fa-caret-right"></i> Status Quo:  "Keep the current color."
			</p>

			<p>
				You can also change the details â€“ So what makes this options special? <br/>
				It is the way we treat it internally. That is if somehow someone hasn't ranked an option at all, it will be treated as if it was ranked as high as the Status Quo. (This can happen if the admin adds a new option after someone has already posted her ranking.)
			</p>
			<p>
				If no Status Quo option is provided, every unranked option is considered to be ranked below all other options.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is done. Your ballot is online. \o/
			</p>

			<p>
				To cast a vote use either of the two links below. The first one ist your admin link. With it you can make changes to the ballot. The second one is the link for others to cast their vote - you should give it to those you want to participate.
			</p>

			<p>
				Admin link: <br/>
				<small>
					<a href = "{{adminLink}}">{{adminLink}}</a><br/>             
				</small>

				<br/>

				Participant link: <br/>
				<small>
					<a href = "{{participantLink}}">{{participantLink}}</a>
				</small>
			</p>

			<p>
				Both links allow you to add as many new partcipants as you like. You can even remove or change the votes of others.
			</p>

			<p>
				Bookmark those links or save them some other way. Without them you won't be able to acces your prefr ballot.
